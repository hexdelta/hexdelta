## Hey there! My name's Mateus, but you can call me Mafari if you'd like!

I'm a software and game developer from Brazil, with an additional background in writing.

Graduated as a technician in Game Development Technologies over at Universidade Feevale, where I learned a bit of everything there is to know about the business of game development.

However, I decided to turn my gift of logical thinking towards the practice of Software Development and, hence, problem-solving as a programmer.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on my recipe app, Grimoire, with more utilities to come! (Probably for tabletop RPGS)
